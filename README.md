# OdinRecipes
For Odin Project recipe website

This project **primarily** explores working with git, and serendipitously makes use of *a little* HTML in the process.

According to the instructions, "The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."

This project should not make use of CSS at this time.
